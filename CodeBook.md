#CodeBook for Getting and Clean Data Course Project

This codebook describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

##Dataset Information

This dataset contain information collected during an experiment tht attched an activity tracker to 30 test subjects while they performed six activities.

The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

More information about the dataset can be found at its source: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data was obtained from the following link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

##Transformations to Dataset
1. ```X_test.txt``` & ```X_train.txt``` are read into R into dataframes called ```X_test``` & ```X_train``` respectively.
2. The variable names from the '''features.txt``` are extracted and used as the column names for the dataframes created in the previous step
3. Subject IDs from ```subject_test.txt``` & ```subject_train.txt``` are added as a new column to the dataframes called ```subjectId```
4. Activity IDs from ```y_test.txt``` & ```y_train.txt``` are added as a new column to the dataframes called ```activity```
5. Combined ```X_test``` & ```X_train``` using rbind
6. ```activity``` & ```subjectId``` columns are converted to factors
7. Factor levels in ```activity``` columns are replaced with the corresponding activity labels from ```activity_labels.txt```
8. Used ```grep``` to find & extract measurements of mean & standard deviation along with the ```subjectId``` & ```activity``` variables
9. Grouped resulting dataset by activity & subjectID variables using ```group_by``` in the ```dplyr``` package
10. Calculated mean of each variable for each combination of activity & subjectId using ```summarize_each```
11. Output resulting dataset as a text file named ```output.txt``` using ```write.table```
